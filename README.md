# LaserBeam - Practical assignment #2 (Bridge beam)
## LaserBeam.py
It's a script for the .pyp file to work. It has to be placed into C:\ProgramData\Nemetschek\Allplan\2022\Etc\PythonPartsExampleScripts\MyPythonPartsScripts
if you're using Allplan 2023, the path is pretty much the same, just instead of 2022 it will be 2023
## LaserBeam.pyp
It can be stored anywhere. Open this file using Allplan Library
